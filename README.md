#Crop_Predictor
📘 Description:
This project predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH level, water availability, and season. By analyzing agricultural data, the system helps farmers and researchers make data-driven decisions to improve yield and sustainability.

🧠 Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Pickle

Techniques: Data Preprocessing, Ordinal Encoding, Feature Selection, Model Training and Evaluation

Machine Learning Models:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Gaussian Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

👩‍💻 Role / Contribution:

Collected and preprocessed agricultural data for model training.

Encoded categorical features (season) using OrdinalEncoder.

Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms to predict crop types.

Evaluated model performance using classification reports and accuracy scores.

Saved the best-performing model using Pickle for future deployment.
